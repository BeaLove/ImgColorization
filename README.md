Colorization of black and white images with a convolutional neural network and rarity-weighted loss function (Zhang, Isola & Efros, 2016). Implemented from scratch and trained on Tiny ImageNet. Best results achieved by using the pre-trained model as a "teacher" and distilling that knowledge into a smaller model (Hinton, 2015).
